        <h3 class="pg2p1">
            My name is Zachary Allnutt. I live in Wake Forest, NC. I'm 25 years old and I'm studying 
            Graphic Design at Wake Tech Community College. I have been a part of a lot of drawing classes
            and classes that teach InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator. I'm mostly into graphic design but 
            I took web design classes because I thought it might be interesting to know how to build a website.
            I started drawing and doing other forms of art when I was in middle school and I decided then that
            I wanted to have a job in design/art when I grew up.

        <h3 class="pg2p2">
            When I'm not doing school work and other things, I like to play video games, watch tv shows and movies, and 
            play basketball. I also like to go to the beach and just sit on the beach and listen to music. 
        </h3>
        <h1 class="goal">My Goals</h1>
        <h3 class="pg2p3">
            My goal is to be a great graphic designer that does designing for big companies. I think that would be
            really cool if, one day, I get recognized for my designs and other things I do for these companies and maybe 
            for myself.
